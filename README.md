# Ground-Track-Visualization

Implemented Earth-centered orbit propagation and ground track plotting using ECI → ECEF coordinate transformations. 
Visualized satellite trajectories on the Earth’s surface over a 24-hour period, handling time systems and rotation matrices for geospatial mapping.

1. Propagated satellite orbit using RK4 integration.
2. Converted positions from ECI to ECEF frame considering Earth’s rotation.
3. Computed latitude and longitude for ground track plotting.
4. Visualized satellite paths on a 2D Earth map over time.

Libraries and modules used:
1. Numpy
2. Matplotlib
3. datetime
